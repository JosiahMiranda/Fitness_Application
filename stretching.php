        <p class="blocktext service">
            Stretching is when you place particular parts of your body into positions that can lengthen the muscles and soft tissues that
            are associated to them. There are two types of stretching, static and dynamic stretching. Static stretching refers to stretches
            that are done without moving, and dynamic stretching refers to stretches that are done whilst moving.

        <h1 class="blocktext service">Stretching isn't for everybody.</h1>
        <p class="blocktext service">
            Acute muscle strains, fractured bones, and joint sprains are all things that one should look out for before even attempting
            to complete these sorts of stretching exercises. If you suffer from any of these, do NOT do the stretching exercises spoken
            about here, as it may very well do you more harm than good.

        <h1 class="blocktext service">Where do I begin?</h1>
        <p class="blocktext service">
            Stretching can be intimidating to get into, but don't worry! Turns out, you don't even need to stretch all of the muscles in your
            body. In fact, it is actually recommended that you moreso focus on your lower half. Calves, hamstrings, hip flexors and quadriceps
            are the most beneficial to start from as they help you most with your mobility.
